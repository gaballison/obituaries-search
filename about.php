           	<h2>About This Index</h2>
			<p>The obituaries listed in this database were indexed by the excellent volunteers and ExperienceWorks staff members in the Indiana Room at the Jeffersonville Township Public Library. The indexes were produced using the newspapers available on microfilm in the Indiana Room. The following table illustrates the newspapers and years that are available to search:</p>
			
			<h3>Newspapers</h3>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Newspaper Title</th>
						<th>Months &amp; Years Covered</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td><i>Evening News</i></td>
						<td>January 1900 &mdash; December 1910<br/>
						January &mdash; December 1950</td>
						<!-- <td>November 1872 &mdash; December 1905<br/>
							January 1937 &mdash; December 1945
						</td> -->
					</tr>

			<h3>Indexed Data</h3>
			<p>Because many different volunteers have indexed obituaries over the years, there are is a variety of information they have indexed. The information that should be included for every obituary (if it was present in the obituary itself) is:
			<ul class="no-bullet">
				<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: green;"></i> &nbsp; Deceased's name (may be just a surname)</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: green;"></i> &nbsp; Name of the newspaper</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: green;"></i> &nbsp; Date &amp; day of the edition of the newspaper</li>
				<li><i class="fa fa-check" style="color: green;"></i> &nbsp; Page &amp; column of the obituary (for papers before 1970)</li>
			</ul>
			Other information that may be available, depending on whether or not the indexer used those categories:
			<div class="row align-center">
				<div class="small-10 medium-5">
					<ul>
						<li>Woman's maiden name</li>
						<li>Nicknames or titles</li>
						<li>Woman's married name (e.g. Mrs. John Smith)</li>
						<li>Deceased's age</li>
